# AI Agent

## Description
An AI agent is an autonomous software system that observes its environment, reasons over data, and takes actions to achieve defined goals. It can adapt its behavior over time using feedback and learned experience.

## Features
- Autonomous decision-making
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Adaptive learning
- Environment interaction

## How It Works
1. Perceives input from its environment
2. Processes information using rules or models
3. Decides on the best action
4. Executes actions and learns from results

## Use Cases
- Automation systems
- Game AI
- Virtual assistants
- Intelligent tools and services

## Purpose
This project serves as a foundational example or template for building intelligent, flexible, and scalable AI agents.
